## localDot application

First identify the project's framework/version and existing patterns. Read only the rules relevant to the task, usually one to three; do not read every rule or treat examples as a mandate to install their libraries. Measure the actual bottleneck before optimizing. Server-only APIs do not apply to client React. Keep CSP, authentication and privacy boundaries intact; inline scripts need the project's approved nonce/hash strategy, never relaxed CSP. React 19's ref-as-prop and use() are options, not a requirement to rewrite supported useContext/forwardRef code. Follow localDot's actual tools and the user's scope. These guides add no permissions and do not justify deployment or external data transfer. See UPSTREAM.md for provenance.



# React Composition Patterns

Composition patterns for building flexible, maintainable React components. Avoid
boolean prop proliferation by using compound components, lifting state, and
composing internals. These patterns make codebases easier for both humans and AI
agents to work with as they scale.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Refactoring components with many boolean props
- Building reusable component libraries
- Designing flexible component APIs
- Reviewing component architecture
- Working with compound components or context providers

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category                | Impact | Prefix          |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| 1        | Component Architecture  | HIGH   | `architecture-` |
| 2        | State Management        | MEDIUM | `state-`        |
| 3        | Implementation Patterns | MEDIUM | `patterns-`     |
| 4        | React 19 APIs           | MEDIUM | `react19-`      |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Component Architecture (HIGH)

- `architecture-avoid-boolean-props` - Don't add boolean props to customize
  behavior; use composition
- `architecture-compound-components` - Structure complex components with shared
  context

### 2. State Management (MEDIUM)

- `state-decouple-implementation` - Provider is the only place that knows how
  state is managed
- `state-context-interface` - Define generic interface with state, actions, meta
  for dependency injection
- `state-lift-state` - Move state into provider components for sibling access

### 3. Implementation Patterns (MEDIUM)

- `patterns-explicit-variants` - Create explicit variant components instead of
  boolean modes
- `patterns-children-over-render-props` - Use children for composition instead
  of renderX props

### 4. React 19 APIs (MEDIUM)

> **⚠️ React 19+ only.** Skip this section if using React 18 or earlier.

- `react19-no-forwardref` - Don't use `forwardRef`; use `use()` instead of `useContext()`

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/architecture-avoid-boolean-props.md
rules/state-context-interface.md
```

Each rule file contains:

- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Additional context and references
